        <p>A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.<br> In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas. <br>The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.<br> The fruits grow upward in clusters near the top of the plant.<br> Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.<br> The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution.<br> The old scientific name for this hybrid, Musa sapientum, is no longer used.</p>
